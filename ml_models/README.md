Machine Learning Models for E-commerce Prediction
This project focuses on building and evaluating three machine learning models designed to improve accuracy in predicting key metrics within an e-commerce dataset. The models were developed and tested on Databricks, a platform optimized for data processing and machine learning development.

Objective
The primary objective was to predict sales and customer behavior metrics using an e-commerce transaction dataset. However, the models demonstrated a high Mean Squared Error (MSE), indicating low accuracy in predictions.

Process Overview
Data Preparation:

Data cleaning and preprocessing (handling missing values, transforming categorical variables, etc.).
Splitting data into training and test sets to ensure objective model evaluation.
Model Development:

Model 1: Linear Regression.
Model 2: Random Forest.
Model 3: XGBoost.
Each model was evaluated using MSE to measure its accuracy.

Evaluation of Results:

All three models produced high MSE, indicating a significant gap between predictions and actual values.
Possible Causes of High MSE
Upon analyzing the models’ performance and the elevated MSE, we considered several possible causes:

Data Quality and Complexity:

The dataset may contain significant noise or outliers that impact the models' ability to generalize well.
The complexity of relationships within the data may be challenging for these models to capture effectively.
Insufficient Feature Engineering:

Important variables may not have been included or transformed adequately, limiting the model’s accuracy.
The absence of derived features that could better capture relationships between variables may have affected performance.
Dataset Size and Representativeness:

An insufficient dataset size or distribution that does not reflect business reality could lead to model overfitting or underfitting.
If certain data segments were underrepresented, the models may have struggled to generalize to specific cases.
Model Limitations:

The selected models may not be well-suited for the nature of this problem. Alternative approaches, such as neural networks or time series models, may better capture the data’s structure.
Potential Issues in the Training Pipeline:

Errors in preprocessing or pipeline setup, such as incorrect scaling or encoding of variables, may have introduced noise into the model.

Conclusion
This process has highlighted the inherent complexities in predictive analysis within e-commerce datasets. Although the high MSE suggests that the current models need improvement, the analysis and experimentation stages have provided valuable insights to guide the development of future models.
