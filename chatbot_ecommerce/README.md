General Chatbot Description
This chatbot is designed to answer questions related to e-commerce data, including details about sales, customers, and products, by using a fine-tuned language model and embedding-based similarity search. The chatbot relies on embeddings and a fine-tuned model to retrieve relevant context from the data and generate informative responses.

Process Steps and Explanation by File
fine_tunning.py
This script is used to fine-tune the language model on e-commerce data. Fine-tuning is done in Google Colaboratory to leverage enhanced computational resources, such as GPUs, that speed up training and allow for larger model adjustments. Key steps include:

Loading the pre-trained model (GPT-2 or similar) and fine-tuning it on the cleaned dataset. This process customizes the model, helping it understand e-commerce-specific language and context better.
After training, the model saves checkpoints, such as results/checkpoint-21. This checkpoint contains the adjusted weights and configurations from the fine-tuning process, which are later loaded to generate more accurate responses in the chatbot.
chatbot_local.py
This script sets up a FastAPI server to manage questions and answers using the fine-tuned language model and OpenAI’s embeddings API. Key parts of the script include:

OpenAI Embeddings: Embeddings are generated using OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002 model, which converts text data into numerical vectors. These embeddings are used to perform similarity searches on e-commerce descriptions and retrieve relevant context.
FAISS Index: FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) is used to store and search embeddings efficiently. The script processes data into embeddings, storing them in FAISS for quick retrieval.
Answer Generation: When a question is received via the FastAPI endpoint, the script uses FAISS to find the most relevant context. This context is combined with the user question and passed to GPT-4, which generates a coherent answer.
API Setup: FastAPI provides endpoints such as /preguntar for users to send questions and receive responses. The server listens for requests and integrates the embedding search with OpenAI’s language generation to deliver responses.
chatbot_ecommerce.py
This is the primary Gradio-based application for user interaction, integrating the fine-tuned model into a user-friendly chat interface. Key components include:

Model and Tokenizer Loading: The fine-tuned model (from results/checkpoint-21) and tokenizer are loaded, with additional handling to ensure compatibility across devices (CPU/GPU).
Data Processing and Embeddings: Similar to chatbot_local.py, this script loads and processes embeddings with FAISS, providing the chatbot with fast access to contextually relevant data.
Response Generation: The chatbot uses the fine-tuned model to generate responses based on both the context (retrieved through FAISS) and user questions.
Gradio Interface: Gradio is used to create an interactive, web-based interface where users can enter questions and receive answers. This interface includes a title and description to guide users on the chatbot's purpose.
fine_tunning.ipynb
This Jupyter Notebook version of the fine-tuning process is structured to be run on Google Colaboratory for optimal GPU usage. It mirrors the fine_tunning.py steps but in a more interactive format, enabling easy experimentation and logging of model performance during training. The notebook facilitates direct access to Google Colab’s resources and allows for the observation of training metrics in real time. After completing the fine-tuning, the model checkpoint (results/checkpoint-21) is saved for later use.

By combining embeddings with a fine-tuned model and providing an interactive interface, this end-to-end solution enables the chatbot to deliver contextually accurate responses based on e-commerce data.
